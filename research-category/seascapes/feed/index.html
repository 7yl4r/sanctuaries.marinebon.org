<p>In July 2016, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary research coordinator Emma Hickerson was alerted to a major coral health issue by sport divers aboard the M/V <em>Fling</em>, diving in the Gulf of Mexico 100 miles offshore of Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>&#8220;The divers were stunned to find green, hazy water, huge patches of ugly white mats coating corals and sponges, and dead animals littering the bottom on the East Flower Garden Bank,&#8221; said Hickerson. &#8220;This reef is normally filled with color and marine life, and is considered one of the healthiest in the region.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Hickerson and National Marine Sanctuary Chief Scientist Steve Gittings reached out to a team of scientists including Frank Muller Karger, MBON PI, and Director of the Institute for Marine Remote Sensing (IMaRS) at USF.  Muller-Karger and IMARS post-doctoral researcher Digna Rueda Roa analyzed satellite imagery from May through August for the affected region and identified a highly unusual offshore movement of very turbid coastal water that impacted the area throughout July and the first week of August. The satellite images of that area of the Gulf of Mexico showed a highly unusual offshore movement of coastal water that affected the Sanctuary through much of July.</p>
<p>The images were used by the FGBNMS and Texas A&amp;M University to plan a rapid response research trip to investigate the Sanctuary die-off.  In the images, the location of the East Flower Garden Bank portion of the Sanctuary, is marked with a red star and the areas with chlorophyll higher than 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> are masked in white.</p>
<p>“Typically at that time of the year, the FGBNMS is near the edge of the coastal water plume,” Muller-Karger said. “The FGBNMS area gets some brackish water but is not totally immersed in it.  In 2016, from June 22 through August 1, the East Flower Garden Banks had a sustained presence of high chlorophyll. The coastal plume was particularly affecting the East Flower Garden Bank.”</p>
<p>The Sanctuary MBON team analysis of an extensive series of satellite images suggest that the event was caused by a combination of anomalous rainfall over Texas in the preceding two months and subsequent runoff, and a coastal upwelling event that advected this coastal water over the Flower Garden Banks.  The normally high chlorophyll concentration along the coast of the Louisiana-Texas coast were accentuated by the heavy rains in the Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi watershed in the previous months, Muller-Karger said.  What is most unusual is the large inflow of fresh water moving offshore from this region, carrying this water over the reefs. Winds and ocean circulation patterns pushed the water farther offshore than is typical.</p>
<p>The Sanctuaries MBON hypothesis is that this nutrient- and organic-matter rich water led to formation of hypoxic plumes or layers at the bottom of the surface low-salinity plume. The hypothesis is that mortality occurred when one of these hypoxic layers intersected the crown of the coral banks. The hypothesis is being tested using historical oceanographic cruise observations of salinity and oxygen, and time series of historical ocean color data collected from satellites.</p>
<p>“The corals in the Sanctuary experienced several anomalies for an entire month, including lower salinity and higher turbidity — which means they’re getting less light and there is more organic matter. This also means exposure to higher bacterial counts created by the decay of the organic matter and most likely hypoxic (low-oxygen) conditions. It is possible that part of the coastal hypoxic zone that develops west of the Mississippi Delta every summer also moved offshore with this massive offshore movement of coastal waters.”</p>
<p>The NASA MODIS image for 13 JUL 2016 shows the massive plume washing over the FGBNMS (marked with a triangle.) The color bar is intended to represent chlorophyll concentration in mg/m<sup>3</sup>, but the concentrations are likely off because of the “contaminating” effect caused by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on the CHL ocean color algorithm, which makes it look like there is more CHL at the surface.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[July 2016 ICES Journal of Marine Science article outlines "Seascapes as a new vernacular for ocean monitoring, management and conservation.” ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The July 2016 article in the <em>ICES Journal of Marine Science</em> “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/73/7/1839/2458882/Seascapes-as-a-new-vernacular-for-pelagic-ocean"><em>Seascapes as a new vernacular for ocean monitoring, management and conservation”</em> </a>defines how new seascape models which can characterize both the spatial heterogeneity of the dynamic fluid environment and other technologies that sample the diversity of marine life can guide conservation, policy, and management strategies.</p>
<p>Maria Kavanaugh, researcher with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and Sanctuaries MBON co-investigator is the lead developer of the MBON seascapes initiative. Kavanaugh and MBON researchers Francisco Chavez, Frank Muller-Karger, Scott Doney along with Matthew Oliver and Ricardo Letelier contribute to this rapidly evolving framework, addressing key issues and outlining future opportunities in the ICES article.</p>
<p>Marine ecosystems face multiple stressors associated with global change, including warming, reduced oxygen, reduced pH, and reduced productivity. Projecting future change is problematic because individual pressures may have different and/or overlapping spatial footprints or affect ecosystems differently at local and global scales. Furthermore, shifting geographies make it difficult for managers and policy makers to adapt to, plan for, or mitigate the multiple stressors on pelagic ecosystems.  The authors propose five recommendations which would focus seascape ecology research in the near-term to better support biodiversity. The recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop and test ecological theories;</li>
<li>Increase spatial, temporal, and spectral scales;</li>
<li>Merge observations with regional and global marine ecosystem models;</li>
<li>Integrate organismal level observations; and</li>
<li>Complement existing management tools and embed seascape ecology and classifications into existing networks</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[USGS and ESRI  have produced a new global, three-dimensional map which delineates ecological marine units (EMU) from sea surface to sea floor.  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 2017. The US Geological Survey and ESRI have produced a global map which delineates ecological marine units (EMUs) as distinct physical environments. The first-of-its-kind mapping of marine ecosystems provides a global, three-dimensional map from sea surface to sea floor that subdivides the ocean into 37 chemically and physically distinct volumetric regions.</p>
<p>The mapping and characterization of the EMUs represent a new spatial framework for organizing and understanding the physical, chemical, and ultimately biological properties and processes of oceanic water bodies. The EMU concept is described in a recent paper by Sayre et al. “A Three-Dimensional Mapping of the Ocean Based on Environmental Data” published in Oceanography Nov. 2016.</p>
<p>The MBON team is working hand in hand with the USGS to define strategies that link the EMUs to dynamic satellite seascapes based on chemical and physical oceanographic climatological data. The USGS and ESRI released the EMU maps and technical report at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) Annual Meeting in Boston, US, April 2017.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MBON researchers are conducting a study to assess relationships between dominant seascapes in the Monterey Bay region and occurrence of various forage species, with an emphasis on anchovy and krill. This study will look at spatial variability at various scales and possibly a regional comparison with the Southern California Bight. Kavanugh et al are assessing how seascapes change both temporally and spatially and can be useful for informing biodiversity assessments in multiple sanctuaries and potential resource management applications (e.g., fisheries, whale entanglement in fishing gear, harmful algal blooms).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High frequency, multi-scale, and synoptic characterization of the four-dimensional variability of the ocean is now possible through improved classification methods, a maturing array of satellite remote sensing products, advances in autonomous sampling of multiple levels of biological complexity, and emergence of observational networks.</p>
<p>Building on this, the U.S. MBON Seascapes team is merging oceanographic and ecological paradigms to improve our ability to observe, manage, and conserve species living in a dynamic seascape, where the boundaries, extent, and location of features change with time.</p>
<p>The Seascapes project is led by the Sanctuaries MBON team which includes: Maria Kavanaugh and Scott Doney, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Frank Muller Karger, Enrique Montes and Dan Otis, University of South Florida (USF), Francisco Chavez, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). Collaborators from the Santa Barbara Channel MBON include: Jarrod Santora, University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For terrestrial and marine benthic ecologists, landscape ecology provides a framework to address issues of complexity, scale, and patchiness. However, unlike spatial landscapes that migrate slowly with time, pelagic seascapes are embedded in a turbulent ocean.</p>
<p>The researchers working on the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network projects in the US are merging ecology, geography, and ocean dynamics to observe, manage, and conserve species embedded in a dynamic seascape mosaic, where the boundaries, extent, and location of features change with time.</p>
<p>Objective classification of seascapes using satellite remote sensing data allows for synoptic assessment of dynamic biogeographic patterns and oceanic conditions in real time. Seascapes have been classified over the MODIS-Aqua record within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Within the two Sanctuaries, seascape maps have been produced at 1 km resolution and eight–day time steps; maps for the larger eco-region (i.e. Gulf of Mexico and California Current, respectively) are produced at 4 km resolution and monthly time steps.  As of February 2016, 18 seascapes have been classified for the Florida Keys, and 12 for the Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>In the dynamic map animations, distributions of water masses with unique satellite-derived surface ocean properties such as chlorophyll-a, normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH an indicator of phytoplankton physiological state), temperature, and light are represented by different colors.</p>
<p>These animations represent mean conditions over several years; conditions at any given time point may be different. These maps allow to understand how pelagic seascapes shift, expand, and contract in time.</p>
