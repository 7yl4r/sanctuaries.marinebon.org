				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 15-17, 2017, the Sanctuaries MBON team hosted a workshop in St. Petersburg, Florida, to define biodiversity data products that meet the needs of local coastal zone and conservation managers, and that can also can be scaled to address one or more of the targets of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number 14.  SDG 14 seeks to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</p>
<p>The Sanctuaries MBON researchers were joined by representatives from OBIS, NOAA, the USGS, and several academic institutions partnering in the US MBON programs. Some of the core issues discussed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>combining environmental and biodiversity observations;</li>
<li>define Essential Biodiversity Variables (as part of Essential Ocean Variables);</li>
<li>structures to use local data and data served through OBIS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting was hosted by the University of South Florida and was sponsored by the NASA Applied Programs office of the Earth Sciences Division, the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the US Ocean Biogeographic Information System (US-OBIS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) including the National Marine Sanctuaries program, and the State of Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute.</p>
<p>In the past year, the Sanctuaries MBON data management team has enrolled more than 50 datasets – some of the time-series span nearly three decades &#8212; into a public data server. The data are available using the <a href="https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html" target="_blank">ERDAPP</a> protocols. The SBC and AMBON teams have also enrolled dozens of datasets.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February 2017 &#8212; The GCOOS MBON DMAC team has enrolled additional fish survey datasets.  MBON recently obtained the NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) data set “Juvenile Sport fish Monitoring in Florida Bay, Everglades National Park, 2004-2015”. This is also being enrolled according to the Marine Biogeography enrollment journal protocol for the Florida key reef fish developed by Philip Goldstein. The species taxonomic data file has been compiled. The team is working on how best to incorporate the different bottom strata into the enrollment template.  The 2016 Dry Tortugas reef fish data have been posted on the Southeast Fisheries Science Center website. The species taxonomic data file has been up dated since new species were added. The data will go through the enrollment process and will be posted on the GCOOS ERDDAP website. (<a href="http://gcoos4.tamu.edu:8080/erddap/info/index.html?page=1&amp;itemsPerPage=1000">http://gcoos4.tamu.edu:8080/erddap/info/index.html?page=1&amp;itemsPerPage=1000</a>).</p>
<p>Fish data from the Fisheries Independent Monitoring (FIM) program led by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission have been transformed by the SE Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA) and will soon be available through the ERDDAP server. The Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) fishery-independent datasets are being assessed for assimilation into the MBON program.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[GCOOS DMAC team Transforms Florida Keys Datasets]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Matthew Howard and Dr. Marion Stössel, members of GCOOS’ Data Management and Communications (DMAC) team have assembled and reformatted environmental datasets for the Florida Keys MBON program. These datasets were produced by various organizations including NOAA’s Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the University of Miami, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
<p>The GCOOS team has been transforming these datasets into NetCDF files along with comprehensive standardized metadata conforming to standards endorsed by the National Centers of Environmental Information (NCEI) NetCDF Feature Templates and USGS’ OBIS-USA. These transformations enable data to be served via the <a href="http://gcoos4.tamu.edu:8080/erddap/info/index.html">GCOOS ERDDAP server</a> which provides data access for both people and automated computer programs.  Datasets transformed by the GCOOS team include fish observations from the Florida Keys Reef Visual Census (1994-2014), the Dry Tortugas Reef Visual Census (1999-2014), the Comparative Assessment of Gulf Estuarine ecoSystems (CAGES) (1998-2005) and the Florida Keys Coral Reef Monitoring Project (1996-2013), and the water quality data (dissolved oxygen, nutrients and others) for the Florida Keys (1970-2013) extracted from the <a href="http://nutrients.gcoos.org/">GCOOS Hypoxia-Nutrient Data Portal</a>.</p>
<p>Environmental data from 31 field surveys (2006-2016) conducted by the University of Miami’s R/V Walton Smith as part of the South Florida program (SFP), and historical and near real-time oceanographic and marine meteorological data from NOAA’s National Data Buoy Center, water level data from NOAA’s National Ocean Survey, and salinity and temperature data from the Everglades National Park will be added to the ERDDAP server.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MBON data integration and coordination strategies were discussed in two sessions at the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) annual winter meeting, Bethesda, MD, USA, 11-13 January 2017. Margaret O’Brien (Santa Barbara Channel MBON) led the “<a href="http://commons.esipfed.org/node/9513">Harmonizing vocabularies for population studies</a>” session which focused on tasks needed to fully operationalize the conceptual “Essential Biodiversity Variables”, or EBVs, so they can be applied to MBON datasets, much the same way that CF Conventions are applied to measurements of physical phenomena, and for closer alignment between Darwin Core terms and the varied field observations managed by MBONs.</p>
<p>The session <a href="http://commons.esipfed.org/node/9515">“Reeling in the biologists: connecting the dots between observers, integrators, and decision makers”</a> hosted by Abby Benson (USGS-OBIS) discussed strategies to produce datasets that can be incorporated into indicators. The group examined connections between MBONs, US IOOS and the Marine Biodiversity Virtual Laboratory (MBVL, funded by NSF) which is developing a computational framework for modeling and predicting biodiversity.</p>
<p>The US MBON DMAC team hold regular calls to work on areas of common interest relating to observations and data that can be incorporated into indicators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dec 2015 &#8212; To create the integrated MBON portal for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuaries, the MBON researchers, the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System DMAC team, and Axiom worked with scientists at NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission&#8217;s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWC/FWRI) to review, curate and enroll historical data sets.</p>
<p>The FWC/FWRI MBON team is led by Kathleen O&#8217;Keife. The FWRI worked with the NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center to segregate the Reef Visual Census data into 37 ecologically relevant trophic groups. The RVC focuses on hardbottom reef habitat between 1-30m depth. The researchers estimated diet composition,  biomass, and other parameter estimates for each trophic group using related Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico based ecosystem models.</p>
<p>The teams transformed 18 years (1995-2012) of the Reef Visual Census (RVC) data from their original forms into the standards-based forms used by OBIS-USA, such as Darwin Core and the Marine Bio-Geography (MGB) common terms definitions. Guidance for this effort was derived from the “MBG 2.1 Enrollment Journal Florida Marine Sanctuaries Fish 2004 Draft 20140521” produced by Philip Goldstein OBIS-USA. The transformed data and metadata were written into NetCDF files and installed in an ERDDAP server making them available through the network via human or URL-based interfaces.</p>
