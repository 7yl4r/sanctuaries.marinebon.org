		<description><![CDATA[FWRI, MBARI, Stanford and USF researchers are using eDNA to assess biodiversity in the Florida Keys and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries.    ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. MBON projects are conducting intensive sampling campaigns within contrasting habitats. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is one of the innovative sampling strategies being tested to assess use as a potential operational tool for monitoring biodiversity at multiple trophic levels.</p>
<p>To characterize biodiversity, from microbes to mammals using eDNA, the Sanctuaries MBON teams are developing state-of-the-art molecular techniques that include standardizing sea water sample collection, filtering, extraction and sequencing so results can be compared across trophic levels and regions, and across various time scales. The teams combine their unique expertise to explore different approaches and research questions.</p>
<p>The Sanctuaries MBON Genomics team includes researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the University of South Florida College of Marine Science (USF) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute/ Florida Fish Conservation Commission (FWRI/FWC) and Stanford University&#8217;s Center for Ocean Solutions (Stanford/COS),</p>
<p>The MBARI team: Francisco Chavez, Reiko Michisaki and Kevan Yamahara. MBARI has extensive expertise in methods development and instrumentation engineering. <a href="http://www.mbari.org/science/upper-ocean-systems/genomic-sensors)">Read more</a>.</p>
<p>The USF College of Marine Science team is led by <a href="http://www.marine.usf.edu/faculty/mya-breitbart">Mya Breitbart,</a> and includes postdoctoral researcher Anni Djurhuus and Ph.D. student Natalie Sawaya.  Breitbart’s lab uses molecular techniques to examine the diversity, distribution, and ecological roles of viruses and bacteria in a wide range of environments &#8211; including seawater, animals, plants, insects, zooplankton, coral reefs, and stromatolites.</p>
<p>The FWRI/FWC team includes research scientist <a href="http://myfwc.com/research/redtide/labs-people/current/hubbard/">Kate Hubbard</a> whose research on toxic algae incorporates traditional and molecular ecology and taxonomy to consider the varied abiotic and biotic mechanisms that influence the biodiversity, distribution, toxicity and evolution of these organisms in the marine environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Evaluation of filtration and DNA extraction methods for eDNA biodiversity assessments across multiple trophic levels. <em>Ecology and Evolution</em></strong> (in review) A., Djurhuus, J. Port, C. Closek, K. Yamahara, O. Romero, K. Walz, D. Goldsmith, R. Michisaki, M. Breitbart, A. Boehm, F. Chavez The manuscript describes the method tests to determine the effects of different filter types and DNA extraction methods on diversity of bacteria (16S rDNA), phytoplankton (18S rDNA), invertebrates (COI), and vertebrates (12S rDNA).</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Environmental DNA (eDNA) Sequencing Provides a Window Into Biological Diversity in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.</strong> The team is using bioinformatics to analyze 18S rDNA and COI data from the three main stations in the FKNMS, collected on the cruises in April, June, September and November 2015. This manuscript, led by USF graduate student Natalie Sawaya and USF research associated Anni Djurhuus, with involvement from the entire Breitbart lab, and FWRI/FWCC team led by Kate Hubbard will compare three biological replicates from each of the different genetic markers, the three different reefs, and the four seasons. The article will include a comprehensive analysis – summarizing the taxonomic groups across all trophic levels that were identified in this eDNA survey and comparing to the species known to be present in the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Comparing Diversity Estimates of Florida Keys Zooplankton Using Traditional Microscopic Versus Environmental DNA Methods.</strong>  The study, led by Anni Djurhuus, (USF) compared three different methods used to assess zooplankton diversity: (1) microscopy versus amplicon (18S rDNA, COI) sequencing of (2) zooplankton tissue, and (3) environmental DNA (eDNA). The first two methods are collected directly from zooplankton net tows while eDNA is collected from the surrounding water, thus allowing researchers to compare eDNA to the physical presence of zooplankton. We also performed surveys with and without a pre-filter on the eDNA samples to determine the influence of copepod nauplii being caught on the filter.  The preliminary results from this study, which demonstrated that most families seen through microscopy were also detected through eDNA sequencing, were presented by Anni Djurhuus at the 2016 Ocean Sciences. Further samples have been collected and processed for an in-depth, statistically robust taxonomic validation of zooplankton biodiversity as determined with eDNA vs. microscopy methods. The full study is completed and bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data is underway. The team is working on a manuscript which will be one of the first studies to ground truth eDNA for documenting pelagic zooplankton diversity in the oceans</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sample Collection and Processing SOPs Established ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After completing several controlled experiments testing different filter types and DNA extraction techniques, the USF, Stanford, and MBARI groups established a standard operating procedure (SOP) for eDNA sample collection and processing. The team identified several protocols for collecting and processing eDNA samples to simultaneously assess biodiversity across multiple trophic levels.</p>
<p>Using the SOPs, the researchers are processing a subset of samples from Florida and California for analyzing the diversity of &#8220;microbes-to-whales&#8221;. Samples will be sent out for sequencing within the next month or two.  All data will be processed through a common bioinformatics pipeline and statistically analyzed together.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Cruises and methods meetings ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>eDNA team sequences mesopelagic fishes from the Davidson Seamount: </strong>In 2015, Andrew DeVogelaere, Research ‎Director of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and MBON eDNA collaborators at the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions Jesse Port, Rebecca Martone, and Collin Closek successfully sequenced DNA extracted from mesopelagic fishes collected with a midwater trawl during a research cruise over the Davidson Seamount in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Genomics Team is comparing the DNA sequences from trawl-caught fish to water samples collected during the same cruise. The cruise was on the NOAA Ship <em>Bell M. Shimada. </em></p>
<p><strong>Meetings to Define SOPs</strong> Several meetings were held to develop standardized sample collection plans and methodologies for use in the Florida Keys and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries. Researchers conducted tests to determine the most effective choices of filter type and DNA extraction method to capture eDNA from multiple trophic levels simultaneously (i.e. bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, vertebrates). Methods for morphological zooplankton identification were completed in February 2015, which will enable comparison of zooplankton data between the Florida Keys and Monterey Bay sites.</p>
<p>To support consistent sample process and analysis, Stanford and MBARI established a bioinformatic pipeline, and USF and FWRI are testing parts of the system. This pipeline will provide a standardized data analysis framework for different gene markers used by the Sanctuaries MBON genomics teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stanford team is also comparing two library prep methods for Next Generation Sequencing data (NGS). The analysis will help to determine whether this step should become standardized in all three MBON projects, as they work in collaboration with the AMBON and SBC MBON genomics researchers.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[MBARI researchers develop and test new technologies to expand sample collection]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past five years, MBARI researchers have been developing and testing new underwater vehicles and designing testing equipment that will autonomously collect, preserve, and process discrete samples. The MBARI team has validated oceanographic samples collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle.</p>
<p>In fall 2015, samples were collected during the MBARI CANON cruise to assess the spatial distribution of vertebrate eDNA across nearshore and offshore locations. The six-month time-series at station M1 in Monterey Bay (six cruises,10 depths sampled per cruise from 0-200 m) has yielded very low/absent amplification for 12S mt DNA (vertebrate eDNA). The Stanford team provided aliquots of this time-series to MBARI researchers who successfully amplified phytoplankton and zooplankton eDNA.</p>
<p>To test if water volume is related to vertebrate eDNA concentration in offshore waters, the team collected and filtered 1-L, 10-L, and 100-L seawater samples at station M1 using tangential flow filtration (TFF). The researchers are comparing species richness and diversity across these volumes, and, to conventional vacuum filtration. Samples have been processed and the experiment may be repeated in another location.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>major coral reefs at the designated MBON stations. Samples are collected with help of the USF remote sensing group and scientists at the FKNMS during cruises on the <em>R/V Walton Smith </em>and on small boats. The USF/FKNMS is collecting three samples from surface and bottom at each of the three key MBON stations &#8211; 18 samples per cruise.</p>
<p>In 2015, the team collected 198 samples from the three MBON stations and an additional 286 samples from the surrounding ocean. In 2016, the USF group also collected samples for zooplankton morphological identifications, eDNA genomics, and for sequencing tissue of whole zooplankton communities. The purpose is to ground-truth the eDNA method for zooplankton and eventually use only eDNA to assess zooplankton diversity and seasonal oscillations in the Florida Keys.</p>
